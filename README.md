Recursive Descent Parser for CS571
**You can parse and output the JSON to represent the results of parsing.**

This Python program provides a lexer and parser. The language supports integers, identifiers, booleans, lists, tuples, and maps. The script reads input from standard input, scans the input to tokenize it, parses the tokens to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and finally, outputs the AST in JSON format.
